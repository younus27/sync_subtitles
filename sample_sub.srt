girl: Hey, guys, what is this?

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,500
Boy: A gate. It connects
the inside and outside.

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,958
Girl: Outside?

5
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:18,583
We've never been outside.

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,333
Boy 2: That's because we haven't
left here since being born.

7
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,583
Girl: So is this what mom
always tells us about?

8
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,208
"Never go near the gate or fence
in the back of the forest,

9
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,750
'cause it's dangerous."

10

Boy 1: She says that,
but it's not true.

11

Boy 2: It's not?

12
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,708
Girl: Hey, ray,
what would you do outside, huh?

13
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:39,083
Ray: I don't know. You, Emma?

14

Boy: This gate...

17
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,708
You know, I wonder

18
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,167
what it's really
keeping us protected us from.

That isn't what I meant.

Norman alone's
smarter than all of us combined,

100

and then there's ray,

101
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:02,145
who's good at solving
any problem he's faced with.

102

To top it off,
Emma learns really fast,

103

so she can keep up
with them, easy.

Right, Conny?

Don: Nah, you don't
have to thank me.

Norman: No, Don. You did.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,270
I tell you this every time.

132
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,728
Your weakness is that you
make a judgment too quickly

133
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,436
and then lose your cool.

Norman!

148

Norman: Just pretending.

149
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:33,145
Emma: What?!
You had me worried about you!

150
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,478

00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,478
I can't believe
he caught me again!

153
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,395
Why do I keep losing?!
So frustrating.

154
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,061
Ray: Question.

155
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,270
What's Norman good at
that you're not?

156
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:47,436
Emma: Hmm.

157
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,395
Uh, planning ahead

158
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:51,103
and staying calm?

159
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:53,645
I guess he's also good
at being smart.

160
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:55,520
Ray: It's strategy.

161
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,436
Just think. If it's about
simple physical ability,

162
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,811
then you have the upper hand,
but it's more than that.

163
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,520
Norman has brains like no other,

164
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:07,395
and tag is a game
where you compete with strategy.

165
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,020
Emma: In a game of tag?

166
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,145
Ray: Way I see it,
tag's like chess,

167
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,770
but using your whole body.

168
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,353
Don't you think so, Norman?

169
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,145
Norman: Yeah, sure. But I'd say

170
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,478
that you're more of a tactician
than I am, ray.

171
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:19,895
Ray: I don't know about that.

172
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:22,645
Emma: So try to anticipate
the enemy's moves.

173
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,270
Norman: But still,
we can't compare

174
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,145
to mom's ability
to read a situation.

175
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,353
Emma: That's true.
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,895
none of us have ever been able
to beat her at chess, huh?

177
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,603

- ( Ray sighs )

178
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:35,103
Don: Norman! Rematch!

179
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,520
Next game, everyone is
gonna be it but you!

180
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,978
Emma: Calm down!

181
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,978
Girl 1:
Don's all worked up again.

182
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:42,978
( Norman grunts )

183
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,936
( Birds chirping )

184
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:51,103
( Boy 3 pants )

185
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,145
( Emma gasps )

186
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,936
( Footsteps echoing )

187
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,811

188
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,353
( Normal footsteps )

189
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,311
( Norman sighs )

190
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:42,145
Guess you caught me.

191
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,645
'ª

192
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,061
Emma: "Never go near
the gate or fence."

193
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:49,270
Norman: Yeah,
mom always tells us that,

194
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,311
because going near there
can be very dangerous.

195
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,686
Ray: She says that,
but it's not even true.

196
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,728
Norman: What do
you mean by that?

197
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,395
Ray: Well, look at it.

198
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:00,645
What part of this
do you find dangerous?

199
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,353
The fence is low,

200
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,395
and I don't see
anything remotely threatening.

201
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,645
Emma: But we should do
what mom told us.

202
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:08,895
Ray: Uh-huh.
You really love mom, don't you?

203
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,895
- Emma: Sure! Everybody does!
- Don: Hey!

204
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,395
What are you guys
doing way back here?

205
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,645
Girl 1: Oh, is the game over?

206
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,353
Norman: We should call it a day.

207
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,061
If we're out too late,
mom will be worried about us.

208
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,895
Don: Someday...

209
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:24,853
We'll have to leave here,
won't we?

210
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,145
Boy 6: This is an orphanage.
Of course we'll leave one day,

211
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,270
by the time we turn 12.

212
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,020
Girl 1: You know, it's weird.

213
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:35,061
None of us
have ever gotten any letters.

214
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,186
- Emma: Letters?
- Girl 1: Yeah,

215
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,186
nothing from any
of our siblings

216
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,561
who've been adopted
over the years.

217
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,728
Norman: Oh, that? I'm sure
they're just being considerate

218
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:44,395
to their foster parents.

219
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,520
Don: But, still,
we were brought here as babies.

220
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,228
We're the only family we know.

221
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,895
Even if we aren't blood-related,

222
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:51,853
we're truer siblings than most!

223
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,728
Girl 1: Maybe the outside world
is so incredible

224
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,561
that they've forgotten
all about life at the house.

225
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,686
Emma: Well, in that case,
let's be happy for them.

226
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,520
( Girl 1 groans )
I want to go outside soon, too!

227
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,353
Boy 6: And what
would you do out there?

228
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,603
Girl 1: Isn't it obvious?
Try out new clothes.

229
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,728
- Don: This again.
- Girl 1: I deserve to!

230
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,228
We only have this one uniform!

231
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:14,103
I read a book one time.
It said the outside world

232
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:16,186
has hundreds of clothing designs
and patterns,

233
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,895
and I want to wear them all!

234
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,978
Boy 6: I wanna eat
all the yummy food.

235
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,561
Don: I can't wait
to find a cute girl to date.

236
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,561
Girl 1: You realize
that's an insult, don't you?

237
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,520
Don: Oh, I didn't
mean it like that.

238
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:28,270
Boy 3: I want to see a train!

239
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:30,186
Don: Hmm, that's a good one.

240
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,520
Emma: And what about you?

241
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,853
Norman: Oh,
well, I want to travel,

242
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,520
to see places
I've never been to before.

243
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:38,520
Emma: Nice! And you, ray?

244
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:40,436
Ray: Once outside...

245
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,020
I'd have to learn
to survive first.

246
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,853
Don: You're such a downer.
And you?

247
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,270
Emma: Who, me?

248
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,145
Ray: You want to ride
a giraffe, right?

249
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,603
Emma: I said that?

250
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,145
I guess I don't really
want to leave,

251
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:55,936
so I'd stay forever.

252
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,478
Don: Come on.
That's not a real answer!

253
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,436
Emma: Why not?
We're all happy here, right?

254
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,686
Ray: Happy? Yeah.

255
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,686
Conny: I promise
to write to you.

256
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,520
I'll write you
stacks of letters!

257
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,186
I won't forget!
You mean too much to me!

258
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,186
- ( Girl 1 sighs )
- Conny: When I grow up,

259
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,061
I want to become a mother
just like mom,

260
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:18,436
and I'd never even think
about abandoning my children!

261
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,311
Girl 1: You love mom very much,
don't you, Conny?

262
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,728
Conny: Mm.

263
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,436

- ( Wind blows )

264
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,520
( Insects chirping )

265
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,603
Conny: I couldn't run fast,

266
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:46,311
and I wasn't as clever
as the rest of you are,

267
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,811
but once I leave,
I'll do my best!

268
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,353
And I can,
with little bunny's help!

269
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,770
Don: Conny.

270
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,228
( Conny whimpers )

271
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,811
I don't want to leave you!

272
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,936
I want to stay right here!

273
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,686
Don: Conny, I'll miss you!

274
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,395
( Conny cries )

275
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,895
( Mom humming melody )

276
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,520
Conny: Um, mom,
what song is that?

277
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,561
( Mom continues humming )

278
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,811
( Clock ticking )

279
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,478
Emma: Conny!

280
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:42,228
You left little bunny?!

281
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,728
Girl 1: Let's hurry
and get the cleaning done.

282
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:46,853
Oh, little bunny?
But Conny's gone!

283
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,603
Emma: What should we do?

284
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,770
- Ray: There's still time.
- Emma: Huh?

285
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:52,436
Ray: Yeah, I could see
from the window

286
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,395
that the lights
at the gate were still on.

287
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,103
Mom hasn't come back yet either,

288
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,561
so I don't think
Conny's left just yet.

289
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,395
- Norman: Let's hurry, Emma.
- ( Emma grunts )

290
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:04,436
( Both panting )

291
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,686
Emma: "Never go near
the gate or the fence."

292
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,561
Norman: Yeah, I know.
We'll both get in trouble later.

293
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:22,228
Emma: Conny?

294
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:31,353
( Liquid dripping slowly )

295
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:49,020
Emma: Is that the truck

296
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,020
that's gonna take Conny
to her new home?

297
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:53,353
I've never seen a vehicle
in real life.

298
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:56,603
Eh?

299
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:06,978
Norman: Hmm.

300
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,020
No one's here.

301
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:19,686
Emma: Maybe she'll find it
if we leave it in here.

302
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,811
Norman: Yeah, maybe.

303
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,103
Eh?

304
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,061

00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,561
- Man: Is someone there?
- ( Both gasp )

311
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,811
Man: Hey, did you
hear voices just now?

312
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,353
Man 2: It's your imagination.

313

314
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,895
( Door creaking )

315
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,936
Man 1: If it was a stray cat,

316
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,395
I would have
caught it for dinner.

317
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,478
Man 2: You eat
those disgusting things?

318
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,395

( Laughs )
It looks so delicious.

325
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,895
Human flesh
is definitely the tastiest.

00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:54,853
Norman: No.

I wish I could have
just a fingertip.

Male demon 2: Don't joke.
It's valuable merchandise,

330
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,770
definitely not something
we are meant to enjoy.

331
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,020
The human flesh from this farm
is the highest quality.

332
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:11,978
Only the rich can afford it.

Demon 3: Another six-year-old.

338
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,020
We've only been shipping out
average ones lately,

339
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,520
but we'll be harvesting

340
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,895

soon enough.

with full marks

We're all just food?

354
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:14,270
( Norman panting )

355
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,645
Emma: It can't be.

356
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:18,728
Didn't everyone go
to foster homes?

357
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:23,270
And mom is a normal,
loving mother, right?

358
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,020
This is all a mistake!
What we saw wasn't Conny!

359
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,728
How could it be?!

360
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,770
Norman: I'm afraid it was Conny.

361
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,478
( Emma sobbing )

362
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,020
( Wailing )

363
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,728
( Wails echoing )

364
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,186
Ray: Welcome home. How'd it go?

365
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,311
Norman: We didn't
make it in time.

366
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,270
( Stairs creaking )

367
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,520
( Woman humming melody )

368
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,186
Emma: Have we been
living here this whole time

369
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,936
just to end up as food?

370
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:09,311
Norman: Let's escape, Emma.

371
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:10,978
We'll get out of here.

372
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:13,270
That's right. We can do it.

373
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,561
Between you, me, and ray...

374
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,436
Emma: And the others,
what about them?

375
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,728
( Sobs ) I can't leave them.

376
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:22,811
If we do,
they'll all be killed for sure.

377
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:24,645
I can't take it.

378
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,686
I don't want to lose
any more family.

379
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,145
( Norman shudders )

380
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,853
( Hummed melody continues )

381
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,728
And you won't have to.

382
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:37,478
( Emma gasps )

383
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,936
Norman: Try not to worry.

384
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,103
We'll flee, all of us.

385
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,561
Emma: Really? But how?

386
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:50,895
How can a bunch of kids
run away from those monsters?

387
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,061
( Gasps ) Strategy,

388
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,728
like when we played tag.

389
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,228
Norman: Right.
We will find a way,

390
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,645
one that ensures
all of us survive.

391
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,103
( Emma grunts )

392
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,811
( Hummed melody continues )

393
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:17,353
( Melody stops )

394
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,895
( Drip echoes )

395
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,145
'ª

396
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:23,853
( singing in Japanese )
